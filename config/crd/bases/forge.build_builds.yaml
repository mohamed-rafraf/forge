                      description: |-
                        Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
                        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
